In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Hotel Booking dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used total 9 machine learning algorithms . In each algorithm I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , I got the highest accuracy of about 97 % using the Random Forest Classifier which is quite well for the given Hotel Booking dataset . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot ,Regplot etc.

During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , I got the highest accuracy of about 98.24 % using the Ada Boost Classifier followed by XGB Classifier with a accuracy score of 97.84% which is quite well for the given Breast Cancer dataset . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot ,Regplot etc.
