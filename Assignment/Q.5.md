The two people I will choose from my batch if I start a software company will be - Raj Singh (RA1911003030018) & Harshit Singh (RA1911028030021) because we have already worked on some projects to help each other out and we also are proficient in our own domains like Harshit Singh is well skilled at data science and machine learning and Raj Singh also knows a lot about the Frontend part. As a software company requires the latest technology, we are well equipped with the skills required to manage and run the company smoothly. Raj Singh apart from this has worked on amazing projects like netflix clone.
